# BlockQuora - Blockchain-based System for Online-Consumer Reviews
BlockQuora is an innovative decentralized platform built on Ethereum, utilizing smart contracts and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), to create a tamper-free and transparent system for online consumer reviews. This readme file provides an overview of the project, its features, and the technologies used.
# Features
- **Decentralized Review Storage**: BlockQuora leverages IPFS to store consumer reviews. The reviews are encrypted, hashed, and stored off-chain, ensuring data integrity and resilience.
- **Smart Contracts for Review Management**: The platform utilizes Ethereum smart contracts to manage the review data. The corresponding hashes of the reviews are stored on the blockchain, providing transparency and immutability.
- **Removal of Intermediaries**: BlockQuora eliminates centralized control by removing intermediaries, ensuring a tamper-free review system. This enhances efficiency and trust, as reviews cannot be manipulated or censored.
- **Cryptocurrency Incentives**: BlockQuora rewards them with cryptocurrencies for each review they submit on the platform to incentivize reviewers. This encourages active participation and contributes to the growth of the review ecosystem.

# Technologies Used
- **ReactJS**: The frontend of BlockQuora is developed using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a responsive and intuitive interface for users to interact with the platform.
- **Ethereum**: BlockQuora utilizes the Ethereum blockchain, a decentralized platform that supports smart contracts. Ethereum enables the secure and transparent execution of smart contracts, ensuring the integrity of the review system.
- **Ganache**: Ganache is a local development blockchain used during the development and testing phase of the project. It provides a lightweight and private Ethereum network, allowing developers to test smart contracts and simulate transactions.
- **MetaMask**: MetaMask is a browser extension that acts as a wallet and allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It is integrated into BlockQuora, enabling seamless transactions and providing a secure environment for users to manage their cryptocurrency incentives.
